# Automate Everything

I've been using bookmarklets for a while now, mostly to automate any browsing required at work. And I also use some for the non-work portions of my life (though the usecase comes up less often). There isn't any point in hoarding handy little toys when it's so easy to share them with the world, so here you go. Make use of my toys and I hope they help \^.^

## My Toys

- [Search My Twitter](https://github.com/ScionOfBytes/bookmarklets/blob/master/searchMyTweetsForPrevPostedContent/README.md)

## Note
Due to github not allowing embedding of bookmarklet in markdown for security reasons, I can't add a drag-n-drop link for these (I really wanted to ðŸ˜•). If anyone finds a way around this, do let me know.
