# Search My Twitter for Previous Post

Whenever I read an interesting article, I make sure to [share it with my followers on Twitter](https://crowdfireapp.com) and I mostly use automated tools to schedule those tweets so the format of the title always ends up being the same. I've been doing this for a while so I have a hundreds of articles shared through my twitter.

Now it so happens that I come across an old, beloved article after a long time and give it another read. And often enough I enjoy re-reading this lovely old article but I can't remember if I've shared it with my twitter followers, yet. So I end up going to Twitter's [Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced) and search for the article's title with myself as the poster. And if I find it I know I have shared it already.

Since this happens a few times a month I decided to automate the process. And so you have this helpful little bookmarklet. Select any text on a page and click it and it'll do a search against your user and tell you if you've posted that bit of text before.

It's not juts drag-n-drop, unfortunately. You'll have to modify the input to the IIFE to have your twitter handle. But the good news is that twitter advance search doesn't require you to be logged in so you can do this from any browser.
