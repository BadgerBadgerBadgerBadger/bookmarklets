# Reveal your Secrets!

The creation of this bookmarklet came about from me often forgetting my passwords. Often would it be that I've completely forgotten a password and the only way I can access anything is because my browser remembers the password and fills it in for me (or some password manager does the same). And I wanna have a look at it so I end up opening up the developer console and changing the type of the password field to `text` and there we go, I can now see my password.

And after having done this manually a few dozen times I slapped my forehead and reminded myself that I'm not a [muggle](https://medium.com/@scionofbytes/modern-day-wizards-57822b6d768e#.hu10uvp32). And hence came about this extremely simple and handy little boomarklet.
